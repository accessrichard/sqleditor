# Installation

The bower version of dgrid "~0.3.16" loses styling on column 
hover but using "0.3.17-dev" from: https://github.com/sitepen/dgrid
is fine.


This folder should have the following:

* codemirror
* dgrid
* dijit
* dojo
* dojox
* intern
* put-selector
* xstyle

To get these modules you can perform an:
* npm install 
* bower install 

Make sure to install them into this directory instead
of the node_modules or bower_components one.
